# Firebase Asynchronous Operation Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with asynchronous operations in Firebase Cloud Functions. The bug involves attempting to use data before an asynchronous call has completed, which can lead to unexpected behavior like undefined values and race conditions. The solution shows how to properly handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations using promises or async/await.

## Bug Description
The original `firebaseBug.js` shows a Firebase function that tries to access and update data before the database query has finished.  This results in inconsistent data and potential errors.

## Solution
The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file presents the corrected version, using `async/await` to ensure data is available before processing. This pattern handles the asynchronous nature of Firebase calls effectively.
